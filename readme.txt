Portal Gun v2.2 by Pandassaurus

This mod is a work in progress! I will continue adding and fixing features as time goes on. 
Please leave all the feedback you can, and feel free to ask me any questions!

This mod brings in the famous Portal Guns from the Portal series to GTAV! Use the heavy pistol to shoot the orange portal, and hold T while shooting to 
shoot the blue portal. Depending on the sound you hear, you will know if the portal has been created or not. Also, you can see if your shot is going to hit if
the crosshair is white, or miss if the crosshair is grey. You can easily go in between the portals by just walking into them, driving into them, or even 
pressing "K" and "L" to go directly to the blue and orange portals, respectively. You can grab entities with E to move them around, and also press Y to spawn 
orange portal on the moon, or hold T and press Y for a blue portal. Have fun!
